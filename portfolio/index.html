            Hello, my name is<strong> Mohammad Zaki</strong>, and I'm happy to be here. I'm originally from Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, and I've had a varied educational experience. I am passed out  from <strong> Jamia Millia Islamia</strong> in 2023 with a diploma in mechanical engineering, which I proudly display. I am currently doing a B.Tech at <strong>integral University</strong>, Lucknow, which involves a change into the fascinating field of computer science. This special fusion of my expertise in computer science and mechanics feeds my love of creativity and problem-solving. I am ecstatic about the opportunity to join any team,  to provide my expertise, and see how my multidisciplinary background may give projects a new viewpoint.
            As a web developer, I use both my technical expertise and creative approach to create unique, user-friendly websites. With a passion for crafting flawless online experiences, I specialise in responsive design and am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm excellent at turning ideas into aesthetically pleasing and useful web solutions since I have a strong attention to detail and a dedication to remaining up to date with industry trends.
